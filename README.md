Snake Game with User Authentication System
This was my very first project after I started learning how to code. It’s a website that combines a classic Snake game with a user authentication system. The authentication features include registration with email verification, login, logout, and password reset.

Project Details:

Start Date: September 2024

End Date: January 2025

What started as a simple project to build login, register, and logout features turned into a bigger challenge when I decided to add a Snake game to push myself further.

Technology Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP and MySQL

Email Verification: PHPMailer

Challenges Encountered:
One of the challenges I faced while building this project was screen scaling. The game and website only look proportional when the screen scale is set to 100%, as I created it on a desktop computer. On laptops with default screen scales of 125%, the design appears distorted. Despite exploring solutions, I couldn’t resolve this issue within the scope of the project.

This project helped me learn and apply both front-end and back-end skills while also solving real-world problems like secure email verification. It reflects my curiosity and willingness to go beyond my initial plans.
